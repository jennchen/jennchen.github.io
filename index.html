<h1>Hi, I'm Jenn.</h1>
<p>I'm currently the UX lead for ChromeOS at Google, working on creating powerful computing that is accessible and affordable for everyone.<br/>
In other lives I've been a part of BigTent &amp; Federated Media and co-founded a travel-planning service called FreezeFare as a part of Founder Labs.<br/>
I like to make things, explore new places near and far, get around on two wheels, bake, and befriend cute animals.</p>
